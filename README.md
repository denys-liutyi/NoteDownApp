# [NOTE DOWN APP](https://denysl.pythonanywhere.com)
**Note down.**
This is a CRUD application for making quick notes on different topics, which a user is interested in.
Notes can be added and read by registered users only.

I mastered basics of:
- Django.
- OOP.
- HTML.
- SQL.
- App deployment.
- Git.

To run the application on your computer, you must set up a virtual environment, install Django in it, set up database and run it on localserver.
